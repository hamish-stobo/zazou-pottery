# zazou-pottery-website
##Portfolio website made for a pottery studio.

##### Check out the dev branch to see the finished repo.

I used nodemailer to generate and send an email messages from the website to the pottery studio owner's email address.
I configured OAuth2 for the website's email address to prevent it getting sent to the spam folder in the studio owner's inbox.

I really wanted to use custom css rather than a framework to learn more about CSS. I also used some simple CSS animations that start when a certain scroll height is reached.
